In this task, we seek to explore the behavior of customers in the various stores.

Check for distribution in both training and test sets - are the promotions distributed similarly between these two groups?

Check & compare sales behavior before, during, and after holidays

Find out any seasonal (Christmas, Easter, etc) purchase behaviors.

What can you say about the correlation between sales and the number of customers?

How does promo affect sales? Are the promos attracting more customers? How does it affect already existing customers?

Could the promos be deployed in more effective ways? Which stores should promos be deployed in?

Trends of customer behavior during store opening and closing times

Which stores are open on all weekdays? How does that affect their sales on weekends? 

Check how the assortment type affects sales

How does the distance to the next competitor affect sales? What if the store and its competitors all happen to be in city centers, does the distance matter in that case?

How does the opening or reopening of new competitors affect stores? Check for stores with NA as competitor distance but later on have values for competitor distance
